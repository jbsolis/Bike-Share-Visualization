## Feedback
1. What do you notice in the visualization?
	* Despite the seasons registered renters remain similar, in terms of trend.
	* As the seasons get warmer the trend in bike usage in normal customers do spike up mostly one can assume for work commutes seeing that bike rentals are higher at 8am and 5pm
	* The peak rental times for registered bikers are highest when people are going or leaving work.
2. What questions do you have about the data?
	* What is registered what is casual?
	* Which city was it populated by?
	* Do the trends change on the weekend of registered bikers?
3. What relationships do you notice?
	* The casual and registered have porportional trends despite season.
	* There is a spike in bike usage
	* Registered bike rentals are highest when people are going or leaving work. Casual rentals is highest in the afternoon.
4. What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?
	* Season does not affect rental trend.
	* I feel like the main takeaway is to show when people are more likely to rent bikes at a certain time and season
	* Trends of bike rentals by season are the same, but average rentals decline in colder seasons.
5. Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?
	* All makes sense, but I just wonder why people are renting bikes late at night.  
	* The graph is straight to the point and I know what you're trying to compare visually
	* None, it makes sense.
